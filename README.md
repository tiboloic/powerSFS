# A Novel Genetic Constraint Metric Based on Mathematical Modeling of the Site Frequency Spectrum of Missense Variants in Large Population Genomics Databases

PowerSFS is a novel metric designed to quantify genetic constraint. Unlike conventional metrics that measure depletion of genetic variation in specific genetic regions, PowerSFS utilizes a simple mathematical model of the site frequency spectrum of missense variants (genetic variations resulting in amino acid changes) to quantify genetic constraint without depending on depletion.

PowerSFS offers valuable insights into the selective pressures shaping genetic sequences, discerning regions under strong purifying selection from those more tolerant to variation.
